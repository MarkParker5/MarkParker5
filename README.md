ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mark Parker, full-stack software engineer

## MajorDom

I'm making [majordom.io](https://majordom.io/blog/welcome-to-majordom) - a smart home of the future that is really smart; a brand new open-source smart home ecosystem, designed for privacy, autonomy, and seamless integration across a wide range of devices. The platform combines easy plug-n-play functionality with intelligent automations and a really smart voice assistant.
